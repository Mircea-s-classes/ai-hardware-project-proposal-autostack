# AI Hardware Project Proposal Template

## 1. Project Title
Autostack

Frank Wu, Tony Xu, Anson Lu, Yingming Ma

## 2. Platform Selection
Platform: Raspberry Pi 5 (maybe with AI Kit as well)

This project builds on our ECE Capstone work: an automated alignment system designed for use under a telescope. Since the system already utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 for motor control, implementing our AI-based detection system on the same platform would be both efficient and practical.

**Undergraduates:** Edge-AI, TinyML, or Neuromorphic platforms  
**Graduates:** open-source AI accelerators (Ztachip, VTA, Gemmini, VeriGOOD-ML, NVDLA) or any of the above 

## 3. Problem Definition
Describe the AI or hardware design problem you aim to address and its relevance to AI hardware (e.g., efficiency, latency, scalability).

## 4. Technical Objectives
List 3–5 measurable objectives with quantitative targets when possible.

## 5. Methodology
Describe your planned approach: hardware setup, software tools, model design, performance metrics, and validation strategy.

## 6. Expected Deliverables
We will provide a working demo of computer vision incorporated into the microscope image analysis. The analyzed result will be used in moter control operations. The training code will be provided in github repo. At the end of semester we will present with a working demo alongside presentation slides. Final report will be delivered if required.
