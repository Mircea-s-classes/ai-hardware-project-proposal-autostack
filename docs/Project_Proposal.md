# AI Hardware Project Proposal Template

## 1. Project Title
Autostack

Frank Wu, Tony Xu, Anson Lu, Yingming Ma

## 2. Platform Selection
Platform: Raspberry Pi 5 (maybe with AI Kit as well)

This project builds on our ECE Capstone work: an automated alignment system designed for use under a telescope. Since the system already utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 for motor control, implementing our AI-based detection system on the same platform would be both efficient and practical.

**Undergraduates:** Edge-AI, TinyML, or Neuromorphic platforms  
**Graduates:** open-source AI accelerators (Ztachip, VTA, Gemmini, VeriGOOD-ML, NVDLA) or any of the above 

## 3. Problem Definition
We will design an AI algorithmn that detects small metal plate on a substrate with image input from integrated camera on microscope. The algorithmn will run on Raspberry PI and guide the motor to align the two metal plates. It will help researchers using microscope to align the sample more easily.

Describe the AI or hardware design problem you aim to address and its relevance to AI hardware (e.g., efficiency, latency, scalability).

## 4. Technical Objectives
List 3–5 measurable objectives with quantitative targets when possible.

## 5. Methodology
Describe your planned approach: hardware setup, software tools, model design, performance metrics, and validation strategy.

## 6. Expected Deliverables
List tangible outputs: working demo, GitHub repository, documentation, presentation slides, and final report.

## 7. Team Responsibilities

| Name | Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------|------------------|
| Frank Wu | Team Lead | Coordination, documentation |

| Anson Lu | Software | Model training, inference |
| Yingming Ma | Evaluation | Testing, benchmarking |

## 8. Timeline and Milestones
Provide expected milestones:

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
|------|------------|-------------|
| 2 | Proposal | PDF + GitHub submission |
| 4 | Midterm presentation | Slides, preliminary results |
| 6 | Integration & testing | Working prototype |
| Dec. 18 | Final presentation | Report, demo, GitHub archive |

## 9. Resources Required
List special hardware, datasets, or compute access needed.

## 10. References
Include relevant papers, repositories, and documentation.
